    "In this project, I classify Yelp round-10 review datasets. The reviews contain a lot of metadata that can be mined and used to infer meaning, business attributes, and sentiment. For simplicity, I classify the review comments into two class: either as positive or negative. Reviews that have star higher than three are regarded as positive while the reviews with star less than or equal to 3 are negative. Therefore, the problem is a supervised learning. To build and train the model, I first tokenize the text and convert them to sequences. Each review comment is limited to 50 words. As a result, short texts less than 50 words are padded with zeros, and long ones are truncated. After processing the review comments, I trained three model in three different ways: \n",
    "\n",
    "<li> Model-1: In this model, a neural network with LSTM and a single embedding layer were used. \n",
    "<li> Model-2: In Model-1, an extra 1D convolutional layer has been added on top of LSTM layer to reduce the training time.\n",
    "<li> Model-3:  In this model, I use the same network architecture as Model-2, but use the pre-trained glove 100 dimension word embeddings as initial input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are about 1.6 million input comments, it takes a while to train the models. To reduce the training time step, I limit the training epoch to three. After three epochs, it is evident that Model-2 is better regarding both training time and validation accuracy."
